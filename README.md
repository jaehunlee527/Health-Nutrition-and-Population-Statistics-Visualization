## Health Nutrition and Population Statistics Visualization

Based on the [data provided by The World Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037652/Health-Nutrition-and-Population-Statistics), I have created visualizations on birth rate, infant mortality and population trends in the last few decades. **Please note: since the ipynb notebook does not provide plotly charts, please visit [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/jayhoneylee527/Health-Nutrition-and-Population-Statistics-Visualization/blob/main/HNP_visualization.ipynb) for full notebook.**

### Datasets
The data.zip consists of two files:
1) HNP_StatsCountry.csv: Country and Region names 
2) HNP_StatsData.csv: Diverse statistics for each country and region
