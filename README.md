## Health Nutrition and Population Statistics Visualization

Based on the [data provided by The World Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037652/Health-Nutrition-and-Population-Statistics), I have created visualizations on birth rate, infant mortality and population trends in the last few decades. **Please note: since the ipynb notebook does not provide plotly charts, please visit [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/jayhoneylee527/Health-Nutrition-and-Population-Statistics-Visualization/blob/main/HNP_visualization.ipynb) for full notebook.**

### Datasets
The data.zip consists of two files:
1) HNP_StatsCountry.csv: Country and Region names 
2) HNP_StatsData.csv: Diverse statistics for each country and region

### Summary

#### Fertility & Infant Mortality Rates
After birth rates have declined rapidly in the late 20th century in major countries, they have remained unchanged for few decades. However, what may be surprising the relatively fast decrease among developing countries - South East Asia, Latin America & Africa. Could this mean that the population growth will slow down in coming era?
